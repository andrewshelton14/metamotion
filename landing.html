                                    Meta Motion combines AI coaching and data from your fitness wearables
                                    to build personalized training plans for real beginners.  
                                    This page explains every major feature and how the technology behind it works.

                                    Instead of guessing what workout to do or copying random online routines,
                                    Meta Motion reads your data, understands your current level,
                                    and turns it into clear daily instructions.  
                                    Every feature on this page supports the same value proposition:
                                    <strong>you always know what to do next, and why it works for you.</strong>

                                    The AI coaching engine is the “brain” of Meta Motion.
                                    It looks at your previous workouts, performance, and consistency
                                    to decide what you should do next.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Analyzes exercises, sets, reps, and RPE/effort level from each session.</li>
                                    <li>Tracks which movements you struggle with and which feel easy.</li>
                                    <li>Gradually increases difficulty using progressive overload so you keep improving.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Instead of a fixed 12-week plan, the AI engine adjusts over time,
                                    so your plan stays challenging but never overwhelming.
                                </p>

                                    Meta Motion connects to your <strong>fitness wearables</strong>
                                    — like Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Oura Ring — to bring real data into your plan.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Data we use:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Daily steps and active minutes.</li>
                                    <li>Heart-rate trends during and after workouts.</li>
                                    <li>Sleep quality and recovery from devices like Oura Ring.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    The app uses this data to automatically adjust workout intensity.
                                    For example, if your sleep and recovery are low, Meta Motion will dial back
                                    the volume for the day, emphasize technique and mobility, and schedule
                                    tougher sessions when your body is ready.

                                    Your schedule as a student or young professional is unpredictable.
                                    Adaptive training makes sure your plan still moves you forward,
                                    even when life gets chaotic.
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>You set your preferred training days and available time.</li>
                                    <li>Meta Motion rearranges or shortens sessions when you miss a day.</li>
                                    <li>The system prioritizes key movements (squats, presses, pulls)
                                        so you never lose your base progress.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    This technology keeps you consistent over months,
                                    not just for a two-week motivation spike.
